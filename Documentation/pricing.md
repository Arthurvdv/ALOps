# Pricing
Let's dive a little bit into pricing. There is a free part for the community, and a paid part for companies with private repos.

## Free for public projects
The tool will be free for publich projects.  All you need to do, is [install](/Documentation/installation.md) the extension in Microsoft Azure DevOps, [set up a build pipeline](/Documentation/SettingUpYourFirstBuild.md), and you are good to go!

## For Companies
If you have a professional company, and you want to set up your builds for private repositories, you have two options:
- **PayPerBuild**: 1 EUR per build, which will be invoiced every month.
- **FixedPricePerMonth**: 200 EUR per month, per project (unlimited repos per project).  

### Disclaimer
The prices can vary in any direction at any time.  Please provide us with feedback about how we can do this better!

## Trial Period
There is no trial period.  To test, you can set up public builds as much as you want, and when happy, apply them on private repositories.
